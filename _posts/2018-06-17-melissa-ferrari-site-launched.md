First posts are terrifying. Throughout childhood, empty diaries and journals stacked up as I feared making an accidental
spelling error on the first page or initiating with a writing style I would come to hate.  Since I became interested in 
coding and data science, I have toyed with the idea of starting a blog for myself, so that I can document my side projects
and phd research, but mainly to see how my coding and/or creativity develops over time.
